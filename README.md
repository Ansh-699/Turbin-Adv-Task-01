# Limited Claim â€” Solana Anchor Program

A minimal on-chain system that manages a fixed number of available spots (for example: event seats, tickets, or access passes).  
The program ensures fairness by allowing only one claim per participant and automatically returning seats when claims are cancelled.

## User Story

**As an organizer**, I want to open a campaign with a fixed number of seats so I can limit how many people can claim.

**As a participant**, I want to claim one seat and be able to cancel it so the seat returns to the pool.

### Acceptance criteria
- The organizer sets the total number of seats when creating the campaign.  
- A participant can claim a seat only if seats remain.  
- Each participant can hold at most one claim at a time.  
- A participant can cancel their claim and the seat becomes available again.  
- Seats available never go below zero or above the original total.  
- All claims and cancellations are recorded so anyone can verify current availability.

## How it works (short)
1. Organizer creates the campaign and sets total seats.  
2. Participants claim one seat each. A claim is recorded.  
3. Participants can cancel their claim, freeing the seat.  
4. The system enforces limits and records changes on-chain for public verification.
